# 🛠️ My VS Code Snippets - Because rewriting code is so 2010
Welcome to this repository where I store all those little pieces of code we end up rewriting 15 times before realizing we’ve already done it. Yes, that’s right, snippets. Why make life harder when you can just let Visual Studio Code do all the work for you, right?

## 🧐 Why snippets?
Because we all know the real reason we use them is to avoid wasting time on basic tasks. Forget about impressing anyone with original solutions here, just the essentials so you don’t have to think through it again and again.

## 🚀 What you’ll find:
Shortcuts to code as if you did it all yourself (without actually doing it).
Snippets that are tested… well, they should work, theoretically.
Less time spent coding, more time spent enjoying the beauty of procrastination in peace.
